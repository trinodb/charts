===========

Fast distributed SQL query engine for big data analytics that helps you explore your data universe


## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add trino https://trinodb.github.io/charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo trino` to see the charts.

Then you can install chart using:

```console
helm install my-trino trino/trino --version 0.21.0
```

Also, you can check the manifests using:

```console
helm template my-trino trino/trino --namespace <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
```

## Documentation

You can find documentation about the chart [here](./charts/trino/README.md).

## Development

To test the chart, install it into a Kubernetes cluster. Use `kind` to create a
Kubernetes cluster running in a container, and `chart-testing` to install the
chart and run [tests](charts/trino/templates/tests).

```console
brew install helm kind chart-testing
kind create cluster
ct install
```

To run tests with specific values:
```console
ct install --helm-extra-set-args "--set image.tag=448"
```

Use the `test.sh` script to run a suite of tests, with different chart values.
If some of the tests fail, use the `-s` flag to skip cleanup and inspect the
resources installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Use `-n` to use a specific
namespace, not a randomly generated one. Use `-t` to run only selected tests.
See the command help (`-h`) for a list of available tests.

Example:
```console
./test.sh -n trino -s -t default
```

The documentation is automatically generated from the chart files. Install a
git hook to have it automatically updated when committing changes. Make sure
you [install the pre-commit binary](https://pre-commit.com/#install), then run:

```console
pre-commit install
pre-commit install-hooks
```
